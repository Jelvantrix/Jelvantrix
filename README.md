## Xynlvantrex Labs

I run **Xynlvantrex Labs** — an independent research and engineering lab focused on building things that have no prior art. Not products that improve on what exists. Things that don't exist at all.

The process is simple: identify a problem nobody has solved the right way, research it from first principles, experiment until something works, then deploy it.

I have the ability to build anything I decide to build and the discipline to see it through. The lab is early. The work is real.

## Projects

---

### HELIX — Transformer Inference Engine
> `Rust` `AI Infrastructure` `gRPC` `Systems`

A production-grade GPT-2 inference engine written entirely in Rust. No PyTorch. No ML frameworks. Every component hand-rolled.

- Custom tensor engine with AVX2/FMA SIMD acceleration
- BPE tokenizer loaded directly from OpenAI's vocab files
- KV-cache with O(1) fork for beam search
- 7 sampling strategies including Mirostat v2
- Zero-copy safetensors loader via memory-mapped files
- GGUF dequantization (Q8_0, Q4_K)
- gRPC streaming API + OpenAI-compatible REST
- Built-in profiler with Chrome trace export
- FLOP utilization benchmarking against theoretical peak

```
117M params · 41 tok/s · 68% FLOP utilization · 38ms TTFT
```

### EREBUS-KRONOS — Custom OS + Compiler Stack
> `Rust` `C` `OS Internals` `Compilers` `Computer Architecture`

An experimental computing stack built entirely from scratch. Not a hobby bootloader — an actual working system.

- Custom 32-bit kernel and bootloader
- Handwritten filesystem
- Desktop environment with working GUI (booted in VirtualBox)
- Custom programming language (Kronos) with its own Rust-written compiler
- Networking stack, audio subsystem, package manager

Everything from the first bootloader instruction to the window manager is original code.

---

### SENTINEL — Cyber Defense Operating Environment
> `Rust` `TypeScript` `Tauri` `eBPF` `Cybersecurity`

A modular, offline-sovereign, zero-cloud cyber defense platform. 46 Rust crates. 12 architectural layers. 464 tests. Built in approximately one day.

- eBPF kernel-level process tracing
- Memory forensics engine
- Malware sandboxing with YARA integration
- Autonomous threat response
- Honeypot infrastructure
- Fully air-gap capable — no external cloud dependency

**→ [github.com/Jelvantrix/SENTINEL](https://github.com/Jelvantrix/SENTINEL)**

---

### AI Desktop Operator — Autonomous PC Control
> `AI` `Python` `Agents` `Computer Vision`

An autonomous agent that controls an entire PC through natural language. No APIs. No overlays. Direct system control across the full desktop environment.

**→ [github.com/Jelvantrix/AI-Desktop-Operator](https://github.com/Jelvantrix/AI-Desktop-Operator)** `In Progress`

## How I Work

I don't use abstractions I don't understand.

Before using any foundational library, I build the thing myself first — not to reinvent wheels, but to know exactly what the wheel is made of. Every project here started with a blank file and grew from first principles.

I work across domains because real systems don't stay inside one discipline. An inference engine needs a tensor core. A tensor core needs memory management. Memory management needs to understand the hardware. You can't draw clean borders between disciplines and still build something serious.

Independent. Xynlvantrex Labs is where I do my most ambitious work.

---

## Open to Work

I'm open to opportunities in any domain I work in — systems engineering, AI infrastructure, security, compilers, distributed systems, or deep-tech research roles.
